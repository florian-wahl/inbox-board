# Inbox Board

Inbox Board is a privacy-first dashboard for managing your email subscriptions and tracking online orders. It connects to your Gmail account (read-only) and automatically detects subscriptions, recent orders, and high-noise sendersâ€”helping you unsubscribe and stay organized. All data is stored and processed locally on your device; nothing ever leaves your computer.

## Features

- **Automatic Subscription Detection:** Finds and lists your active email subscriptions.
- **Order Tracking:** Extracts and displays recent online orders and purchases from your inbox.
- **Unsubscribe Suggestions:** Identifies high-noise senders and provides one-click unsubscribe options (when available).
- **Privacy-First:** All email data is processed and stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB. No data is sent to any server.
- **Configurable Sync:** Choose how many days of email to scan and batch size for syncing.
- **Dark/Light/System Theme:** Customizable appearance.
- **Database Management:** Easily purge all data or just email data from your device.

## Privacy & Data Handling

- **Google Login:** Uses Google OAuth to request read-only access to your Gmail. No email is sent or modified.
- **Local-Only Storage:** All emails, parsed subscriptions, orders, and preferences are stored in your browser (IndexedDB). No cloud or server storage.
- **Open Source:** You can audit the code to verify privacy claims.
- **Easy Data Deletion:** Use the Settings page to purge all data or just email data at any time.

## Tech Stack
